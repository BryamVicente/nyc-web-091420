# Object Orientation

## Questions
- || = operator? ====> Google it! 
- Can you give some examples of when we would not use attrs, but instead use explicit definitions of setter and getter methods?

## What is OO == Object Oriented Programming
- Icebox / blog idea : OO Programming v Functional Programming 

Facebook 
- User ===> username, first name, last name, age, birthday
- Locations
- Tags 
- Statuses
- Posts
- Likes
- Friends
- Groups
- Photos
- Comments ==> the user that posted it, the post it was added to, when it was added, content 

Ruby 
- variables
- hashes
- arrays
- classes
- strings
- integers
- bools
- floats 

they have attributes, and they have methods. We interact with them through methods. 


Classes ===> Blueprints to create Instances 


## Agenda

- Teach our app what a `User` is (OO & why it matters)
    - A `User` has a `name` (instance variables)
    - A `User` has an `age`
    - A `User` has `ss_number`
    - A `User` can change their `name`, `age`, and `ss_number` (methods)
    - A `User` should be able to say it's `name` and `age` (macros)
    - A `User` should not be able to show their `ss_number` (now we show the last 4 digits)
- A `User` can sign in, view, and edit their personal information


## Icebox
- regular expressions/multiple deliminators(spelling?) with the split method 
    - revisit after Caryn shows you where to look at potential solutions
    - blog idea? 
- can you iterate over an array AND use count() at the same time?
- TERNARY OPERATOR <3 <3 <3 Blog idea. 
- When we get to more complex labs check out `config/environment.rb` for requiring multiple files easily
