# Ruby Enumerables & Pry

## Prerequisites

- DataTypes 
    - strings, booleans (true and false), array, hash, integers, floats, 
    - nil, undefined 
    - symbols 
- Conditionals - if, elsif, else end, while, ||, &&, unless, case, booleans
     if n > 5 ====> true/false
- Loops - while, for, until, count, .times, enumerables, parameters
- Arrays vs Hashes
- Accessing Arrays & Accessing Hashes
- Iterating through Arrays and Hashes using `.each`

### Familiar with and learning to love
- block notation, curly bracket notation, do/end notation

## Agenda

- Mindset - build iteratively, test often, think about my toolbox
- Enumerables:
    - .each
    - .map/.collect   ==> to do the same thing for each item in an array and put that into a new array
    - .filter/.select/.find_all ==> collect all items for which the block returns true into a new array
    - .find ==> find the first item that the block returns true for and return it
- Pry
- Require (local) vs Gemfile (run bundle install)
- Show where this code lives on github and how to access it! 
- Git advice...
    pay attention to where you are in terminal (ie which folder are you in)
    


## Icebox
 - Ruby and Hoisting ==> Blog idea! 
 - Ruby, Global Variables and Look Up ==> Blog idea! 
 - ~/bash_profile aliases  ==> show an example! 
 - Big O notation & effiency 


### Specific folx notes
- Sisan nested while in each not hitting pry
