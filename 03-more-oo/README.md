## Agenda
- Class methods
- `self`
- private methods

- A `User` should be able to log in
- `User.all` should return a list of all user instances 
- A `User` should be able to introduce themselves
    - `User#introduce` should return a string that says "Hi, my name is _____"
- A `User` should be able to keep track of number of profile views
    - `User#views` should return the number of times a user's profile has been viewed
    - Everytime a user's profile is viewed a message should puts to the screen saying "here is your profile"




Time permitting...
- A `Animal` class with a name (read and write-able) and a species (readable)
- `Animal.all` should return a list of all animal instances
- `Animal.find_by_name` should take in a string and return the animal with that name
- `Animal.find_by_species` should take a string and return a list of all animals of that species
